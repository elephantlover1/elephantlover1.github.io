<p>Hi, I'm Knox! I am a Pit Bull mix and I am four and a half years old. I was rescued by my dad at six months old and since then life has been the best. I love to play outside with my best friend Daphne and I make sure we share every toy when playing. I love "FaceTime" with my parents. Basically I just love putting my face on their face so they can't pay attention to anyone or anything else but me. I <b>LOVE</b> being the center of attention.</p>
