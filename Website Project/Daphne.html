<p>Hi, I'm Daphne the yellow lab! I just celebrated my ninth birthday on January 7th with my best friend Knox and my parents, Paige and Kris. It was the best birthday because I ate eat ice cream, played outside, and got a huge bone for a present. </p>

Other than playing outside, my interest are eating, napping, and cuddling. I love everything about food! Anytime my parents go to grab my food bowl I jump up and down off the floor with a big smile on my face. If I hear my parents grabbing food for themselves I run over to see what they have with the biggest puppy dog eyes because maybe they will share. It's hard for them to resist my puppy dog eyes! I don't like my photo taken but my mom insist on taking pictures of me constantly, most of the time I don't look impressed.
